# Altruistic-ReinforcementLearning

Reproduction of [*The emergence of altruism as a social norm* by Pereda et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07712-9)

Expectations, exerting influence through social norms, are a very strong candidate to explain how complex societies 
function. In the Dictator game (DG), people expect generous behavior from others even if they cannot enforce any sharing 
of the pie. Here we assume that people donate following their expectations, and that they update their expectations after 
playing a DG by reinforcement learning to construct a model that explains the main experimental results in the DG.
